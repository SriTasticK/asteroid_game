# 🚀 Asteroid Game

**Asteroid Game** is a simple arcade-style space shooter written in **Python** using **Pygame**.  
This is a fun project created by me just for fun while learning and experimenting with game development!

✨ The gameplay is inspired by the classic _Asteroids_ arcade game where:
- You control a spaceship
- You dodge and shoot asteroids
- The goal is to survive and clear as many rocks as you can
